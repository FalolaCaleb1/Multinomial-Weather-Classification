# Multinomial-Weather-Classification
Here is a machine learning project and report using Supervised learning models to classify multiclass weather types, I also used an ensemble technique for optimization, hyper parameter tuning, dimensionality reduction and lots more in achieving a model score of 96%. Please do well to engage and contribute.
